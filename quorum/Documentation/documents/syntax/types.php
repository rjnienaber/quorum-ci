<h2>Primitive Types in Quorum</h2>
<p>
    When programming a computer, we often say that a variable has a type. For 
    example, suppose that I have a variable with the name &quot;a.&quot; It could be the 
    case that this variable is a number, like 4.2, or it could be some text that 
    we have written for a book, like, &quot;It was the best of times.&quot; In 
    Quorum, there are several types, and if those types are not enough, we 
    can define our own. In this section, we go over the various types allowed in the Quorum programming language.
</p>
<h3>integer</h3>
<p>
    An integer is a number, either positive, negative, or zero, that does not 
    have a decimal point. You can create an integer in Quorum by declaring it 
    as follows:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
integer a = 10
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    This would create a variable, named a, that has the value of 10. Similarly, 
    while we can use the word "integer" before the variable named a, we can
    also optionally leave that off, like so:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
a = 10
</code></pre></p>
<h3>number</h3>
<p>
    A number is similar to an integer, except that it allows decimal points. 
    For example:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
number a = 10.4
</code></pre></p>
<p>Like before, the type annotation in this case is optional. We can either
tell Quorum it is a number directly or we can allow Quorum to figure this out
on its own. Either way, once Quorum has detected what a variable is defined as,
it is fixed to that type to help prevent accidental mistakes. Like before, we
can leave the type annotation off as so:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
a = 10.4
</code></pre></p>
<h3>boolean</h3>
<p>
    The type of boolean has only two possible values, true and false. We can 
    create a boolean as follows:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
boolean a = true
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    To use a boolean, we can either create it directly, like above, using the 
    keywords true or false. Alternatively, booleans come up regularly in computers 
    when we compare different values. For example, suppose we had two integers, 
    a and b, and we wanted to see whether a was &quot;bigger&quot; than b. We 
    could do this using the following code:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
integer a = 5
integer b = 6
boolean answer = a &gt; b
c = true or false //or we can allow Quorum to figure out the type, like before
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    The variable "answer" in this case would be set to false, as a is less than b.
</p>
<h3>text</h3>
<p>
    The text type is designed to let you use normal written text in your computer 
    program. You can type any phrase, from a phrase to a page in a book. You 
    can create a variable of type text as follows:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
text a = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
</code></pre></p>
<h2>Type conversion</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes you need to convert one type to another. This is called converting 
    types, or more commonly, type casting. Suppose, for example, that you had 
    text like so:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
text someText = &quot;4.2&quot;
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    This text has the value of 4.2, which looks like a number would, but how 
    would you convert it? In Quorum, you do this using the cast action:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
number someNumber = cast(number, someText)
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    The word cast here indicates to the computer that you are requesting that 
    the value of &quot;someText&quot; be converted into an actual number. 
    Keep in mind that we can pass invalid values here, like &quot;stuff&quot; 
    that is not a valid number. In these cases, our program alert us to the fact
    that there is an error on the system. We can learn more about errors on the
    <a href="errors.php">errors</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    You can learn more about casting on the <a href="casting.php">type casting page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Variable names</h2>
<p>
    While you can create variables of many types, the names are constrained. 
    First, any variable you name must start with a letter, and it can be 
    followed by any number of characters, numbers, or underscore characters. 
    For example, any of the following names would be allowed:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
integer sally = 5
integer billy_likes_sally = 10
integer billy_likes_sally2 = 15
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    However, all of the following names are not allowed:
</p>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
integer 5sally = 5 //a number cannot be the first character
integer _sally = 10 //an underscore cannot be the first character
integer sall&amp;&amp;%%^$*#(y //not all characters are allowed to be used in names
</code></pre></p>
<p>
    Besides the variable names and types mentioned here, we can also create our 
    own custom types. More information can be found on this in the section 
    on <a href="classes.php">Classes</a>.
