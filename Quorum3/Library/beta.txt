Quorum 3.0 Beta 1:

This is the first beta test file for the Quorum 3.0 compiler. Given that this is a 
public beta, there are several features the team is still working on. Here is a 
list of known issues.

1. Text-to-speech is disabled in Quorum 3 beta 1. The reason is because we are 
still finishing up a patch for newer versions of Mac OS X. We are waiting to 
integrate until that work is finished. This includes both the "say" command
and the Speech library.

2. Several unit tests still fail. The reason is because the team is not yet finished
porting over Quorum 2's test suite and we are generating new ones to account 
for design changes in Q3. We are almost finished with this process.

3. The templating/generics/type system still needs some testing.

4. The -web flag, the flag that asks Quorum to generate a .war file,
has not been tested for the beta. We plan to finish this up for the final release.

5. The exceptions system, under some rare conditions, outputs a rather cryptic message,
which was a holdover from Quorum 2. If an exception is thrown, under any condition, 
and it does not have a corresponding stack trace come out, it's a bug and should
be reported.

6. Assignment on an object parent call is currently disabled (e.g., test:parent:Class:variable = ...).

7. There is no support for development environments yet (e.g., NetBeans).

As always, given that this is a beta compiler, users that find any issues at all 
should feel free to file a bug report. As we go through this process, we will be paying
attention to the database looking for anything users report is not working
as expected.
