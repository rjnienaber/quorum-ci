     <h1>Getting Help</h1>
    <h4>The Quorum Google Group</h4>
    
    <p>Developers, students, and teachers, at any skill level, are welcome to 
        submit questions or responses to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quorum-language">Quorum Google group</a>. This group 
    is the primary way in which we prefer people get help, as it is the easiest 
    way for our team to manage requests.</p>
    
    <h4>The Quorum Facebook page</h4>
    
    <p>If you want to discuss the Quorum project more publicly, feel free 
        to post on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/quorumlanguage">Quorum Facebook page.</a></p>
    
    <h1>Contributing</h1>
    
    <p>If you are interested in contributing source code to the project, first check
        out the current source branches: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/stefika/quorum-language">Quorum source code</a>.
    We generally keep the latest versions on the main branch, using the Git 
    version control system.</p>
   
    <h4>Changes to the Quorum compiler</h4>
    
    <p>We are picky about submissions to the Quorum compiler itself.
    Technical submissions will be given a close eye and changes to the core language require 
    evidence on the impact they have on human beings. With that said, if you are a 
    compiler writer and know what you are doing, we do accept submissions.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h4>Libraries</h4>
    <p>In addition to changes to the Quorum compiler, we also accept submissions
        to libraries for the language. Libraries of any kind are accepted and can
        be submitted to the <a href="http://quorumlanguage.com/submit_library.php"> Library submission page</a>.
        Accepted libraries will be included into the standard library for the language 
        and will be placed under the BSD license. 
        
    <h4>Evidence</h4>
    <p>Do you have evidence from the scientific literature that you think should impact
    part of Quorum's design? If so, we accept submissions from either material you have
    written yourself, or links to peer-reviewed works you believe are relevant. Submissions
    go through a review process and may be looked at by experts in several fields. 
    For a submission to be accepted, it must be possible for us to independently
    replicate it. This means that any study must have a replication packet that
    we can publicly host.
