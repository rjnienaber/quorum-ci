The Motor class represents a physical motor. Each motor has a designation, 
an integer, that says which motor it is (e.g., 0, 1, 2 or 3). In order to use
a motor we need to set connection with the motor first and then use the motor 
for other operations. Generally most of the motors have 1 circumference = 1100 ticks.
The maximum speed with which the motor can move is at 1000 ticks per second. In 
order for us to specify the speed at which the motor has to move, speed must be 
mentioned in terms of the percentage of the maximum speed.
