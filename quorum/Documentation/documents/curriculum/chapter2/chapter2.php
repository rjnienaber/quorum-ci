<h1>Chapter 2: Variables and Types</h1>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol><li>What is the difference between a primitive type and an object?
</li><li>Given the line of code below, what will the computer do? Be sure to describe what each word does, including the dot.
</li></ol>
<p><pre class="code"><code>
use Libraries.Sound.Music
</code></pre></p>
<ol start="3"><li>Describe the difference between implicit and explicit type casting. Give an example in Quorum code of each.
</li><li>Describe the concept of an action and what it is used for.
</li><li>Describe the four primitive types. In each case, say a) the name of the type, b) what that type stores in it, c) give an example of its use.
</li><li>What is optimization?
</li><li>What is code completion?
</li><li>Which operator is used to call actions? Similarly, which operator separates values in a <code>use</code> statement (Hint: think of the world wide web)?
</li><li>Describe the concept of instantiating an object in your own words. Be sure to give at least one example in Quorum code.
</li><li>Suppose that we had another object representing a <code>Dog</code>. The <code>Dog</code> object lived at <code>Libraries.Animals.Dog</code> and could bark, an action which took no parameters. Write Quorum code to a) gain permission to use the <code>Dog</code> object, b) instantiate the <code>Dog</code> object, and c) make the dog bark.
</li><li>Give definitions for the following Quorum keywords: a) <code>cast</code>, b) <code>mod</code>, c) <code>undefined</code>.
</li><li>Using code completion, find the full name of the <code>File</code> object.
</li><li>Using code completion, find the full name of the <code>Math</code> object.
</li><li>Using code completion, find the full name of the <code>Array</code> object.
</li><li>List 2 general rules you should follow when naming a variable.
</li><li><strong>Hard</strong>: The word <code>undefined</code> is used to indicate in Quorum on object that has not been instantiated. Try to come up with another reason, besides the one listed in the chapter (optimization) why an object might be undefined.
</li></ol>
<h2>Essay Questions</h2>
<ol><li>Discuss each data type and explain why they should be used.  Be sure to include all primitive types and objects and provide the brief explanations of variables and why the variables are important to understand.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Hard</strong>: There are many computer programming languages in computer science. Quorum, as we have discussed is a statically typed programming language. However, many languages use dynamic typing. Investigate the use of dynamic typing in other programming languages and write a short essay on what dynamic typing is. In your essay, mention at least two programming languages, besides Quorum, that use static typing and two more that use dynamic typing. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach.  (Hint: Do some research on the Internet to help you complete this essay.)
