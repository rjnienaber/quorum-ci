		<h1>Learn About Quorum</h1>
		<p>On this page, we describe how to write executing
                    Quorum programs. We focus 
                    our attention on the core language features, namely 
                    1) creating and using variables, 2) control structures, 
                    3) classes and actions, and 4) libraries and extensions.</p>

	<h3>Variables and Types</h3>
	<p>
	    It is often helpful to be able to tell the computer to remember 
	    information while it executes a computer program. For example, 
	    you might ask the computer to remember how many dollars are in a 
	    bank account or grades on an exam. In this section, we discuss the 
	    various ways of storing data in the Quorum programming language.

	</ul>
	<h3>Control Structures</h3>
	<p>
	    Often times we want to control how the computer processes information. 
	    For example, we might want the computer to do one operation if a 
	    variable is greater than 10 and another if it is less then 10. Or, 
	    we might want the computer to take the same steps repeatedly. 
	    Together, these ideas are called control structures. In this section, 
	    we talk about the control structures that are available in the 
	    Quorum language.

	    <li><a href="documents/syntax/if.php">If</a>: Do something only when a condition 
	        is true</li>            
	</ul>
	<h3>Classes and Actions</h3>
	<p>
	    As computer programs become larger, it often helps to organize 
	    computer code in a variety of ways. Probably the two most common 
	    ways to organize code are to use structures that hold a collection 
	    of data (called &quot;classes&quot; in Quorum), and a way for code 
	    to take a certain behavior (called &quot;actions&quot; in Quorum). 
	    Below are links to how these organizational mechanisms are used in 
	    the Quorum Programming Language:

	        deal with errors (called exceptions in other languages).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Libraries and Extensions</h3>
	<p>
	    As Quorum is a new programming language, we are still building the
	    standard library. In this section, we discuss this library, how you
	    add to it, and general recommended coding standards.
