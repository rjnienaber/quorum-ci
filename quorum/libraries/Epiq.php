    <h4>What Is the EPIQ Workshop?</h4>
    <p align="justify">
        The Experience Programming in Quorum (EPIQ) 
        Workshop is an international professional development workshop for educators 
        to learn the foundational skills necessary to teach students computer science using the Quorum 
        programming language. Click on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Jrn6KrRqV7t7Ryh0uTM1_d3Go6W2EcOAxOVjXjmfvE/edit#">Sign up form</a> if you would like
        to apply.
    </p>

    <h4>What is Quorum?</h4>
    <p align="justify">
        Quorum is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) based programming language that 
        was invented by Dr. Andreas Stefik and others. Check the primary 
        <a href="http://quorumlanguage.com/">Quorum Website</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h4>Who can attend?</h4>
    <p align="justify">
        Any educator (K-12 or post-secondary) with an interest in learning about an 
        exciting, fully-accessible programming language and how to teach it to ALL 
        students, including students with visual impairments and blindness can attend.
        We do open the workshop to others, but generally give priority to educators.
    </p>

    <h4>What do we learn at Epiq?</h4>
    <p align="justify">During the week, you will learn computer programming while working through the 
        student curriculum. You will be provided direct instruction in the 
        programming activities and will also be given 
        resources to implement the curriculum with your students.</p>

    <h4>What kind of students can learn programming?</h4>
    <p align="justify"> We believe that all students can learn to program. This 
        program is accessible to all students. Quorum has been designed and evaluated in 
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534973">scientific, peer-reviewed, studies</a>
        , providing evidence of its ease of use. Given it is also based on the 
        commercial-scale Java Virtual Machine, a wide variety of commercial applications
        can be built with the technology (e.g., games, websites). Quorum
        also has built-in accessibility for students with disabilities,
        particularly those with visual impairments and 
        blindness.</p>



    <h4>Where Is Epiq held?</h4>
    <p align="justify"> The EPIQ Workshop is held on the campus of the Washington State 
        School for the Blind in Vancouver, WA.</p>



    <h4>When is Epiq held?</h4>
    <p align="justify">This year, the dates are: July 17-23, 2014</p>



    <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
    <p align="justify"></p>
    We work to accrue external funding to make it possible
    for teachers to come and learn for free. Corporate sponsors that want to
    help, should contact the organizers.


    <h4>Where do we stay and how much does it cost?</h4>
    <p align="justify"></p>
    Free housing is provided on the campus of the Washington State School for the 
    Blind. Housing is “dorm-style” with each attendee having their own room.  The 
    “cottages” have a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and living room. Internet is 
    provided for free throughout the campus.  However, there are hotels in the area, 
    if you would prefer to stay off-campus at your own expense. We do not have
    unlimited space in our free housing, so please apply as soon as possible
    to ensure you obtain a spot.

    <h4>What about food?</h4>
    <p align="justify">Breakfast and lunch are provided by the WSSB and provided in the school’s 
        cafeteria. The food is not your “typical” school food and special diets 
        are accommodated.</p>


    <h4>What about travel to Vancouver, WA?</h4>
    <p align="justify">Vancouver, WA is on the border with Oregon and literally “across the river” 
        from Portland. Air travel is easy in and out of the Portland International 
        Airport. At this time, we are securing funds to provide a select number of 
        applicants with stipends to help cover travel costs. However, stipends are
        not unlimited and we will base the number we provide on available funding.</p>


    <h4>What about travel around Vancouver/Portland?</h4>
    <p align="justify">Transportation to and from the airport will be provided by the workshop. The 
        workshop organizers will attempt to provide transportation around the area for 
        dinners, trips to the stores, etc. However, individuals are welcome to rent a 
        car or drive their own cars. Free parking is available.</p>



    <h4>What will we do all day?</h4>
    <p align="justify">You will work with leading professionals on learning how to program in Quorum 
        while working through the curriculum that you would use with your students. 
        Your presenters will include the inventor of the language, Dr. Andreas Stefik, 
        along with other leading professionals. Days typically start around 8:00am 
        (breakfast) and end around 4:00pm each day.  We provide ample breaks and a sizable 
        lunch break. </p>



    <h4>What will we do in the evenings?</h4>
    <p align="justify">That is your choice!  You can plan a trip with fellow travelers and go 
        see the local sights.  Or, go explore the local cuisine in the Vancouver/Portland 
        area.  Or, order a pizza, sit in the living room, and relax with 
        friends. Portland is a cool town, so lots of potential activities are
        available.
    </p>

    <h4>Do we do anything together for fun? </h4>
    <p align="justify">This year, we are planning a day-trip to some local sites as part of the workshop.  
        Plan to enjoy visiting a piece of the beautiful Northwest!  </p>



    <h4>What is the weather like there during July?</h4>
    <p align="justify"> July is a wonderful time to be in this area of the country. 
        The highs are around 80 with lows in the mid-50s. It is typically sunny and 
        the area is lovely with its flowers blooming all around. Portland is known 
        as the “Rose City” for a reason!</p>


    <h4>Why else should I come?</h4>
    <p align="justify">Did we mention that during this time you will be introduced to
        wonderful fellow educators from around the world? For teachers of the visually 
        impaired (TVIs), this is an opportunity to be surrounded by like-minded people 
        all working to provide their students with excellent learning opportunities.</p>


    <h4>So what do I do now?</h4>
    <p align="justify">
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Jrn6KrRqV7t7Ryh0uTM1_d3Go6W2EcOAxOVjXjmfvE/edit#">
        Apply!</a> The applications will be processed 
    and reviewed by the EPIQ organizers. Depending on funding levels, we will invite 
    as many participants as possible. However, travel honorariums are based upon 
    funding amounts and applicant qualifications.</p>
    
    <h4>My question still isn't answered. How do I get help?</h4>
    <p align="justify">We recommend visiting the 
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quorum-language">Quorum Google Group</a> 
    or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/quorumlanguage">Quorum Facebook page</a> first.
    If you still can't get help, you can
