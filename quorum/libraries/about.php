<h4>What kind of programming language is Quorum?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Quorum is a general purpose tool that we call an "evidence-based" 
    programming language. It started as an interpreted
    language originally designed to be easier to hear through screen readers
    for blind or visually impaired users. Eventually, Quorum became a general
    purpose programming language designed for any user. Current versions compile to 
    Java Bytecode and run on the Java Virtual Machine, similarly to JRuby, Jython, or Scala. 
    Quorum 3.0 also compiles to JavaScript and can be run from the web. 
</p>
<h4>What are the high level technical details of Quorum?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Quorum has many features. It is object-oriented, but this is largely hidden
    from new users. It has a general purpose type system, with generics for 
    containers (e.g., arrays, hash tables, lists). Quorum also has a 
    standard library, which contains many additions to the language, like
    math libraries, containers, web components, or other features.
</p>

<h4>How is Quorum funded?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Quorum's initial funding started as part of a National Science Foundation 
    project (NSF CNS-0940521). Current funding for Quorum also comes from the 
    National Science Foundation (NSF CNS-1440878). Other funders include the Washington
    State School for the Blind, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, the 
    University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the Do it program at the University of Washington, 
    amongst others.

    <td>Melissa Stefik</td>
    <td align="justify">
    Melissa was the co-inventor, along with Andreas, of much of the Quorum programming language. 
    She wrote the original implementation for the inheritance system, generics, 
    aspects of the type system, and the Java Bytecode writer. She wrote a substantial
    portion of the Quorum 1 and 2 versions of the compiler. Melissa contributed
    substantively to the Quorum textbook.

    <td>Jeff Wilson</td>
    <td align="justify">Jeff was an undergraduate student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
    He worked predominately on accessibility issues in the development environment 
    for Quorum (Sodbeans). This included work on the magnification system, speech system,
    and a variety of other components on the project, including the Quorum 2 compiler. 
    Jeff contributed to the Quorum textbook.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Susanna Siebert</td>
    <td align="justify">Susanna was a co-author on several publications related to the Quorum
    project and was heavily involved in the design of studies testing syntactic
    variants of versions of Quorum. She also helped write chapter 3 of the 
    Quorum textbook.</td>

<h4>What platforms does Quorum support?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Quorum can be run on most platforms that support the Java Virtual Machine. We have
    run Quorum on various versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
</p>
<h4>How can I contribute to the Quorum project?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    There are many ways to contribute. If you have technical skills
    and want to contribute to the standard library, you can either make a pull request
    or get in touch with our development team. If you prefer to make a <strong>tax-exempt</strong>
    donation to the Quorum project, you can do so through the Quorum Outreach and Research
    Foundation by getting in touch with the development team. 
    An easy way to make a financial contributions online is in the works.
</p>
<h4>Can I attend the annual Quorum conference (Experience Programming in Quorum)?</h4>
<p align="justify">
    We do hold an annual conference on Quorum. While we do accept applications to
    attend, usually in March, this conference is invitation only. If we receive 
    a sufficient number of requests, we may eventually open the conference up to
    the general public.
