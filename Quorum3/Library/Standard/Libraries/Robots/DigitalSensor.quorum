/*
The Digital Sensor class represents a physical digital sensor. Each senor has a 
designation, an integer, that says which port it is connected to(e.g., 8 to 15). 
Once the sensor is connected to the port, we can get the value read by the digital 
sensor and we can also output a value to the sensor. Digital Sensors are yypically 
used for bumpers or limit switches.

class DigitalSensor is Connectable
    /*
        This action connects the sensor to the specified digital port. The sensor 
        can read values only after it is connected to the port.
        
        Attribute: Parameter port to which we intend to connect the sensor to
        Port values vary from 8 to 15.

        Attribute: Example
        
        DigitalSensor digital
        digital:SetPort(10)
        //sensor is connected to digital port 10
    */

        This action returns the port to which the sensor is connected to.

        Attribute: Returns the port to which the sensor is connected to

        Attribute: Example
        
        AnalogSensor digital
        digital:SetPort(6)
        integer port = digital:GetPort()
    */

    /*
        This action returns the digital value of the sensor, which is either 0 
        or 1. This value represents if the sensor switch is open or closed. If 
        the switch is open, it is represented by 1. If the switch is closed, it 
        is represented by 0. 

        Attribute: Returns an integer 0 or 1. If the digital sensor switch is 
        closed 0 is returned, otherwise 1 is returned.

        Attribute: Example
        
        DigitalSensor digital
        digital:SetPort(13)
        integer digitalValue = digital:GetValue()
        //returns the current value of the sensor connected to port 13
