<!--<h1>Challenge Assignment: The Game of Pig</h1>-->
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
The goal of this assignment is to learn the following:
</p>
<ul><li>How to design your program using object-oriented programming
</li><li>How to build multiple classes
</li><li>How to design your own actions within each class.
</li><li>How to use class variables
</li><li>How to use objects
</li></ul><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The game of pig is a dice rolling game. In this game a player will play against the computer in an attempt to bank a total of 100 or more points. Sounds easy, but there is a catch, if either the player or the computer rolls a 1 their turn ends and no points are added onto the players total.
</p>
<p>
Here are the rules of the game:
</p>
<ul><li>The players will roll a six sided die (values 1 to 6).
</li><li>If a player rolls a 1 that players turn ends and their turn points are lost.
</li><li>The player will select when to bank their points and when to roll.
</li><li>The computer will continue to roll until they roll a 1 or their turn total is greater than or equal to 20.
</li><li>If the computer's turn total is greater than or equal to 20 the computer will bank those points.
</li><li>The human player will always play first. 
<ul><li>If the computer and the player reach 100 points or more at the same time it will be a tie.
</li><li>If one player reaches 100 they will win(only if the other player does not reach 100 in the same number of turns).
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Create a Quorum application and name it <strong>Pig</strong>. This project will need 4 additional classes, <strong><code>PigGame</code></strong>, <strong><code>Die</code></strong>, <strong><code>ComputerPlayer</code></strong>, and <strong><code>UserPlayer</code></strong>. Design each class such that <code>PigGame</code> is responsible for playing the entire game and setting up the rules. <code>Die</code> should represent a 6 sided die and you should be able to roll that die. The <code>ComputerPlayer</code> and <code>UserPlayer</code> classes should be similar. They should allow the player to take a turn in the game, store the turn and total score for that player, access the total score, and determine if the player is in a winning state.

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre class="code">Welcome to the game of pig!
During your turn you can roll and add those points to your turn total or hold to bank your turn points.
If a 1 is rolled you will bust and no points will be banked.
The first player to bank 100 points is the winner.
